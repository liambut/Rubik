Welcome to my project!

Instructions for playing with the cube:
Rubiks cube moves are noted by the first letter of their name, Up being U and Up Inverse being UI.
Adding an "I" to the end of the moves turns that face counter clockwise rather than clockwise.
By pressing the corresponding key on your keyboard you can make that move, and holding left shift while making the move will invert it.
Move list:
U- white face
F- red face
R- blue face
L- green face
B- orange face
D- yellow face
M- reset cube
Enjoy and keep an eye on the project as new functionality will be added regularly!
